      <h1>BMI Calculator</h1>
      <h2>What is BMI?</h2>
      <p>
        BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on
        height and weight. It is used to assess whether a person has a healthy
        body weight for their height. BMI can also indicate the risk of certain
        health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.
      </p>
      <h2>How to calculate BMI?</h2>
      <p>
        BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in
        meters squared. For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 m tall,
        your BMI is 70 / (1.75 x 1.75) = 22.9 kg/m2.<br />You can also use an
        online BMI calculator to find out your BMI easily. Here is one example
        of a BMI calculator1.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the BMI categories?</h2>
      <b
        >According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five main
        BMI categories for adults:</b
      >
      <ul>
        <li>Underweight: BMI below 18.5 kg/m2</li>
        <li>Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2</li>
        <li>Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9 kg/m2</li>
        <li>Obese: BMI above 30 kg/m2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These categories may vary depending on factors such as age, sex,
        ethnicity, and muscle mass.

      <h1>Perfect Plane Diet:</h1>

      <h2>What is the perfect plane diet?</h2>
      <p>
        The perfect plane diet is a diet that helps you maintain or achieve a
        healthy BMI while traveling by plane. Traveling by plane can be
        stressful and disruptive for your normal eating habits, especially if
        you cross different time zones or have long flights. You may experience
        jet lag, dehydration, bloating, constipation, or cravings for unhealthy
        foods.
      </p>
      <br />
      <b
        >To avoid these problems and keep your weight in check, you should
        follow some simple tips for your plane diet:</b
      >
      <p>
        Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your flight. Water helps
        you stay hydrated, flush out toxins, and prevent overeating. Avoid
        alcohol, caffeine, and sugary drinks on the plane. These beverages can
        dehydrate you, disrupt your sleep cycle, and increase your appetite.
        Choose healthy snacks and meals on the plane or bring your own. Opt for
        foods that are high in protein, fiber, and healthy fats, such as nuts,
        seeds, fruits, vegetables, yogurt, cheese, eggs, or lean meat. Avoid
        foods that are high in salt, sugar, or fat, such as chips, cookies,
        candy, or fried foods. Eat according to your destinations time zone.
        This can help you adjust to the new time zone faster and avoid jet lag.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>For example:</strong>
        If you are flying from New York to London, you should have breakfast
        when it is morning in London, even if it is still night in New York.
        Move around on the plane as much as possible. Sitting for long periods
        can slow down your metabolism and cause blood clots. Try to get up and
        walk around every hour or do some stretches in your seat. By following
        these tips, you can enjoy your plane trip without compromising your
        health or weight goals.
